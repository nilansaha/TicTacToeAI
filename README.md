### TicTacToeAI

There are two modules to search for potential TicTacToe moves for either player - Naive Search and Simulation Search

#### Naive Search

Search for all potential moves(states) up to all end states in a brute force way and see which next move gives the highest win to loss ratio

```
python naive_search.py
```

#### Simulation Search

Simulate moves(states) up to potential end states upto a certain number of iterations and see which next move gives the highest win to loss ratio

```
python simulation_search.py
```
